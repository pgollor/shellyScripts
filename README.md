# Shelly Scripts

Script collection for Shelly Plus devices.

The new (2024) Shelly BLU Wall Switch 4 (SBBT-004CEU) didn't work with the defaukt scripts because the switch transmit multiple button objects at the same time and only the last button was processed by the default script.
I changed the script so that it works with multiple obejcts from the same type.
